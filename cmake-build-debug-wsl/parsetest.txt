my mother meropÃª of dorian line. and i was held to be the proudest in corinthia,
Pg num: 45

Paragraph Text: 
and claimed the truth; and they rose in their pride and smote the mocker.... aye,
Pg num: 46
Paragraph Text: 
they satisfied all my desire; yet still the cavil gnawed my heart, and still the
Pg num: 46
Paragraph Text: 
story crept abroad. at last i roseâ€”my father knew not, nor my motherâ€”and went
Pg num: 46
Paragraph Text: 
forth to pytho's floor to ask. and god in that for which i came rejected me, but
Pg num: 46
Paragraph Text: 
round me, like a flame, his voice flashed other answers, things of woe, terror, and
Pg num: 46
Paragraph Text: 
desolation. i must know my mother's body and beget thereon a race no mortal eye durst
Pg num: 46
Paragraph Text: 
look upon, and spill in murder mine own father's blood. i heard, and, hearing, straight
Pg num: 46

from where i stood, no landmark but the stars to light my way, fled, fled from the

Paragraph Text: 
dark south where corinth lay, to lands far off, where never i might see my doom of

one in daze i walked, till, at the crossing of three ways, a herald, like thy tale,

Paragraph Text: 
and o'er his head a man behind strong horses charioted met me. and both would turn
Pg num: 46
Paragraph Text: 
me from the path, he and a thrall in front. and i in wrath smote him that pushed

meâ€”'twas a groom who led the horses. not a word the master said, vv. 808-828

Paragraph Text:

 but watched, and as i passed him on the road down on my head his iron-branchÃ¨d

Paragraph Text: 
goad stabbed. but, by heaven, he rued it! in a flash i swung my staff and saw the
Pg num: 47

old man crash back from his car in blood.... then all of them i slew. oh, if that

Paragraph Text: 
man's unspoken name had aught of laÃ¯us in him, in god's eye what man doth move more
Pg num: 47
Paragraph Text: 
miserable than i, more dogged by the hate of heaven! no man, kin nor stranger, any

that fear i set thee free.

Pg num: 58
Paragraph Text: 

Pg num: 58
Paragraph Text:

stranger: fear lest thou take defilement from the two that gave thee birth?
Pg num: 58
Paragraph Text: 
oedipus: 'tis that, old man, 'tis that doth fill the earth with terror.

Paragraph Text: 
to him.
Pg num: 59
Paragraph Text: 
oedipus: coming so, from a strange hand, he gave me that great love?
Pg num: 59
Paragraph Text: 
stranger: he had no child, and the desire thereof held him.
Pg num: 59
Paragraph Text: 
oedipus: and thou didst find somewhereâ€”or buyâ€” a child for him?
Pg num: 59
Paragraph Text: 
stranger: i found it in a high glen of kithairon. [movement of jocasta, who stands

Pg num: 60
Paragraph Text: 
stranger: 'twas a spike through both thy feet. i set thee free.
Pg num: 60
Paragraph Text: 
oedipus: a strange scorn that, to greet a babe new on the earth!
Pg num: 60

Pg num: 61
Paragraph Text: 
oedipus: what shepherd? know'st thou not? declare all that thou knowest.
Pg num: 61
Paragraph Text: 
stranger: by my memory, then, i think they called him one of laÃ¯us' men.

Paragraph Text: 
oedipus: this woman, she is proud, methinks, and fears my birth and name will mar

Paragraph Text: 
her nobleness. but i, no shame can ever touch me. i am fortune's child, not man's;
Pg num: 64
Paragraph Text: 
her mother face hath ever smiled above me, and my brethren of the sky, the changing

Paragraph Text: 
moons, have changed me low and high. there is my lineage true, which none shall wrest

power, o zeus, when the riddling breath was stayed and the maid of death slain, and

Paragraph Text: 
worst. ye cannot see. howbeit, with that which still is left in me of mind and memory,
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
ye shall hear her fate. like one entranced with passion, through the gate she passed,
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
the white hands flashing o'er her head, like blades that tear, and fled, unswerving
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
fled, toward her old bridal room, and disappeared and the doors crashed behind her.
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
but we heard her voice within, crying to him of old, her laÃ¯us, long dead; and things
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
untold of the old kiss unforgotten, that should bring the lover's death and leave
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
the loved a thing of horror, yea, a field beneath the plough for sire and son: then
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
wailing bitter-low across that bed of births unreconciled, husband from husband born
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
and child from child. and, after that, i know not how her death found her. for sudden,
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
with a roar of wrath, burst oedipus upon us. then, i ween, we marked no more what
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
passion held the queen, but him, as in the fury of his stride, "a sword! a sword!
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
and show me here," he cried, "that wife, no wife, that field of bloodstained earth
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
where husband, father, sin on sin, had birth, polluted generations!" while he thus
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
raged on, some godâ€”for sure 'twas none of usâ€” showed where she was; and with
Pg num: 74
Paragraph Text: 
a shout away, as though some hand had pointed to the prey, vv. 1261-1286
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 

Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
 he dashed him on the chamber door. the straight door-bar of oak, it bent beneath

Paragraph Text: 
his weight, shook from its sockets free, and in he burst to the dark chamber. there
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
we saw her first hanged, swinging from a noose, like a dead bird. he fell back when
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
he saw her. then we heard a miserable groan, and straight he found and loosed the
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
strangling knot, and on the ground laid her.â€”ah, then the sight of horror came!
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
the pin of gold, broad-beaten like a flame, he tore from off her breast, and, left
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
and right, down on the shuddering orbits of his sight dashed it: "out! out! ye never
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
more shall see me nor the anguish nor the sins of me. ye looked on lives whose like
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
earth never bore, ye knew not those my spirit thirsted for: therefore be dark for
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
ever!" like a song his voice rose, and again, again, the strong and stabbing hand
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
fell, and the massacred and bleeding eyeballs streamed upon his beard, wild rain,
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
and gouts of hail amid the rain. behold affliction, yea, afflictions twain from man
Pg num: 75
Paragraph Text: 
and woman broken, now made one in downfall. all the riches yester sun saw in this

Pg num: 76
Paragraph Text:

Pg num: 76
Paragraph Text: 
speak. and his intent is set, to cast himself in banishment out to the wild, not
Pg num: 76
Paragraph Text: 
walk 'mid human breed bearing the curse he bears. yet sore his need of strength and
Pg num: 76
Paragraph Text: 
of some guiding hand. for sure he hath more burden now than man may endure. but see,
Pg num: 76
Paragraph Text: 
the gates fall back, and that appears which he who loathes shall pityâ€”yea, with
Pg num: 76
Paragraph Text: 
tears. [oedipus is led in, blinded and bleeding.] the old men bow down and hide their

Paragraph Text: 
old wrong.
